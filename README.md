# Bedrock Parity Plugin

A modest plugin to bring a few Minecraft Bedrock features to Minecraft Java.

This plugin was written for SpigotMC v1.20.4.

## Features

* Salmon drop Bone instead of Bone Meal.
* Players can apply Bone Meal to small flowers.

## Bugs

### Duplicate flower generation

The flower generation process here is a "best estimate" based on some fairly crude statistical observations.
The distribution of generated flowers, and the proportions of generated Poppy and Daffodil flowers produced when applying Bone Meal to the other type of flower, may not precisely match those in Bedrock.
